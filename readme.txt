Code Kentucky Data Analysis 1 Final Project

I have developed a fascination for aviation over the last few years, especially how planes work and why they sometimes do not. To that end, I've pulled the data for all commercial airline crashes from 2015 through 2020 to analyze for this project. Having never actually thought to look at data like this before, this has added a new layer of intrigue to my explorations on this topic and others.

You will find a walkthrough of each requirement and explanation of each feature in this Jupyter notebook. The packages you will require are as follows:

pip install pandas

pip install numpy

pip install matplotlib.pyplot

pip install openpyxl

*For full disclosure, I encountered an error when attempting to push my final commit that my remote contained work that my local did not. I had tried to add my readme then deleted it immediately before, so I can only assume that was the culprit. It took me a little bit to troubleshoot, I did a git pull on my remote repo to match it with my local, then pushed the repo again. That seems to have worked, although it put me over the official 11:59am cutoff. I understand that my project might be sugject to failing for not meeting the requirements in time. I thought it was important at least to ascertain what the problem was and solve it if I could. Thank you.
