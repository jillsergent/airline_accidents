Code Kentucky Data Analysis 1 Final Project

I have developed a fascination for aviation over the last few years, especially how planes work and why they sometimes do not. To that end, I've pulled the data for all commercial airline crashes from 2015 through 2020 to analyze for this project. Having never actually thought to look at data like this before, this has added a new layer of intrigue to my explorations on this topic and others.

You will find a walkthrough of each requirement and explanation of each feature in this Jupyter notebook. The packages you will require are as follows:

pip install pandas

pip install numpy

pip install matplotlib.pyplot

pip install openpyxl
